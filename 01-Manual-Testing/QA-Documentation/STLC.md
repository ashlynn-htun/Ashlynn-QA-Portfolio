# Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) – How I Use It in Real Projects  
**Author:** Ashlynn Htun  

Instead of treating STLC as theory, I use it as a **practical workflow** for planning and executing tests efficiently.

---

## 1. Requirement Analysis  
What I do:
- Read user stories / requirements  
- Identify unclear or missing acceptance criteria  
- Highlight edge cases early  
- Decide what needs to be tested manually vs. automated  

Deliverables:
- List of questions for clarification  
- Early test scenarios  

---

## 2. Test Planning  
My focus:
- What is the scope?  
- What is out of scope?  
- Which environments and data do I need?  
- What risks should we watch for?  

Output:
- A concise, practical test plan (the one in my portfolio)

---

## 3. Test Case Design  
My approach:
- Write clear, reusable test cases  
- Include both **positive** and **negative** flows  
- Ensure coverage for:
  - Functional paths  
  - Validation rules  
  - UI behaviour  
  - Error states  
  - Security considerations  
- Prioritise based on risk and business impact  

Tools/Formats I use:
- Excel sheets  
- BDD-style scenarios  
- Lightweight checklists for exploratory testing  

---

## 4. Test Environment Setup  
What I prepare:
- Valid accounts  
- Clean test data  
- Browsers, extensions, proxies  
- Local apps (e.g., **Mock Post Editor** in this portfolio)  

This step avoids delays during execution.

## 5. Test Execution  
How I execute:
- Follow test cases systematically  
- Stay observant for unexpected behaviours  
- Perform exploratory testing in parallel  
- Log bugs with strong repro steps and screenshots  

My mindset:  
> “Follow the script, but think beyond the script.”

---

## 6. Defect Reporting  
My defect reports include:
- Clear title + severity/priority  
- Consistent repro steps  
- Expected vs. actual results  
- Screenshots or logs  
- Notes describing impact  

Goal: Make it **easy for developers to fix quickly**.

---

## 7. Test Cycle Closure  
What I deliver:
- Execution summary report  
- Outstanding defect list  
- Retest results  
- Regression notes  

---

## 8. Summary  
STLC is not just a sequence of steps—it’s a practical framework I follow to ensure that testing is thorough, organised, and traceable.  
It keeps my testing disciplined while still leaving room for exploration and creativity.
