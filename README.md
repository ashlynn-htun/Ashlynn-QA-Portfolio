# Ashlynn QA Portfolio

Welcome to my **QA Portfolio** — a collection of projects demonstrating my skills in **manual testing**, **automation**, **API testing**, **database validation**, and **release testing**.  
Each section reflects how I approach software quality through structured testing, curiosity, and attention to detail.

## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Ashlynn** — an aspiring **Quality Assurance Tester** with a strong interest in understanding how products work, why they break, and how to make them better.

I enjoy:
- breaking things (politely 😌)
- finding patterns in behaviour and bugs
- writing clear, structured documentation
- improving user experience through careful testing

I’m currently focusing on:
- strengthening my manual QA foundation  
- building confidence in automation with Playwright  
- learning more about API testing and SQL  
- developing clean communication and reporting skills  

I also have an interest in front-end development and UI/UX, which influences how I test and think about product quality from a user’s perspective.

## 📂 Portfolio Structure

This portfolio is organized into key QA areas:

### 01-Manual-Testing
Contains documents and examples of my manual testing work, including:
- **Test Plans**: Detailed plans for testing e-commerce functionality.
- **Test Cases**: Structured test cases for login, post creation, and user profile modules.
- **Test Scenarios**: High-level testing scenarios covering main user flows.
- **Bug Reports**: Example bug reports with clear reproduction steps and impact assessment.
- **QA Documentation**: Foundational QA knowledge including SDLC, STLC, testing types, design techniques, and feature testing approach.

### 02-Automation-Foundation-Playwright
Demonstrates basic automated testing using **Playwright**, with a clear Page Object Model structure:
- **Tests**: End-to-end automated scripts for login, post creation, and search functionality.
- **Pages**: Page Object classes for modular and maintainable tests.
- **Reports**: HTML test execution reports generated from automation runs.
- **Configuration**: `playwright.config.ts` and `package.json` for setup and running tests.

### 03-API-Testing
Shows foundational API testing skills:
- **Collections**: Postman collection of basic API requests (GET/POST/PUT).
- **Reports**: Exported test results and execution summaries.
- **Documentation**: Notes and insights on API testing methodology.

### 04-Basic-Database-Testing
Illustrates basic database validation:
- **SQL Checks**: Queries for verifying user and post tables.
- **DB Reports**: Summaries of database test results and observations.

### 05-Release-Testing
Demonstrates knowledge of testing during software releases:
- **Regression Test Execution**: Tracking execution of regression tests.
- **Smoke Testing Checklist**: Quick validation of critical functionalities.
- **Post-Release Test Report**: Summary of post-release verification and findings.
