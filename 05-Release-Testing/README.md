# 🚀 05 — Release Testing  
> **Status: In Progress**

This folder contains documentation and templates used for **release readiness**, **smoke testing**, and **post-deployment validation**.  
The goal of this section is to demonstrate understanding of real QA release workflows used in Agile and CI/CD environments.

---

## 📄 Included Files

### ✔ **Smoke_Testing_Checklist.md**
A lightweight checklist covering essential smoke scenarios executed immediately after deployment to ensure the application is stable.

### ✔ **Regression_Test_Execution.md**
A working template for recording full regression run results, including pass/fail counts and notable issues.

### ✔ **Post_Release_Test_Report.md**
A structured summary document used after a release to communicate testing outcomes, risks, and recommended follow-ups.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Section
Release testing ensures:

- The build is stable enough for deeper testing  
- No critical paths are broken before or after deployment  
- Regression is consistently tracked across versions  
- Stakeholders receive clear, structured reports  

This section of the portfolio reflects practical QA deliverables used in **real software release cycles**.

---

## 🔧 Planned Enhancements
- Add complete regression matrix  
- Add release gating criteria (entry/exit)  
- Add traceability matrix (requirements → test cases → bugs)  
- Add examples of multi-environment release workflows  
- Add sample defect logs with prioritisation  

---

This section will expand as I continue developing more advanced release and deployment testing documentation.
