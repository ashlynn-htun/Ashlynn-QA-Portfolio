# API Test Reports

This folder is reserved for storing future API execution reports.

At this stage of the portfolio, I am focusing on:
- Designing Postman requests
- Writing API test scenarios
- Validating responses (status codes, payloads, headers)
- Organising tests into a Postman collection

As I continue developing this section, I plan to add:
- Collection Runner execution screenshots
- Sample test runs (manual)
- Automated reports using Newman (future enhancement)

**Status:** In Progress
